### Evergreen Challenge Submission


This is my submission to Kaggle's evergreen challenge, which challenged
participants to classify StumbleUpon webpages between those that were long-lasting
(evergreen), and those that were ephermal - ie., had little value to recommend
a few days or weeks after being written.

On interesting finding from this work was that recipes for holidays were typically
evergreen, with the exception of super bowl recipes, which were consistently ephemeral.
